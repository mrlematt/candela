# candela
sequencer engine for mega candela installation
created first in 2016 for Fete des Lumi√®res played in Vienne.

2016 version included various Max Fo Live devices, sending midi to drum racks and other max for live devices (to drive a DMX program).

2017 version is going (hopefully) to be a full max/msp patch, at least for all the midi sequencing, because the abuse of max for live devices was a bit unstable-ish.
