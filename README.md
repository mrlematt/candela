# candela
sequencer engine for mega candela installation
created first in 2016 for Fete des Lumi√®res played in Vienne.

2016 version included various Max Fo Live devices, sending midi to drum racks and other max for live devices (to drive a DMX program).

2017 version has been improved. some bugs removed. It stills relies heavily on Ableton and MaxForLive, sending midinotes to DMXis. 

We aim to use Max for the sequencing part + Jitter matrices to send OSC commands to MadMapper, so we can use also video files to control dmx.
